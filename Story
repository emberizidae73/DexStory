Lexi was sitting around a campfire listening to a story being spun by her fellow girl-scouts.  The girl telling the story said “…and then….Lexi, catch!”.  Even though she was startled, Lexi caught the unraveling ball of yarn.  That was how the game worked.  A girl would tell part of a story and toss the ball of yarn to another girl, who would pick up where the other left off.  So, Lexi said “and then… ummm… and then the madman turned into a harmless kitten.  The kitten came up to the children and meowed. Then…”.  Lexi looked around for someone to toss the yarn to.  “Sandy, catch!” said Lexi, tossing the yarn.
